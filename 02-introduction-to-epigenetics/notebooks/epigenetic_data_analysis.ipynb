        "Welcome to this hands-on exploration of epigenomic data analysis. In this notebook, we'll work through real epigenomic datasets to understand how DNA methylation and histone modifications regulate gene expression across different cell types and how these patterns change in development and disease.\n",

        "- **Histone modification landscapes** - Mapping the histone code around genes\n",
        "- **Chromatin state classification** - Identifying active, repressed, and poised genomic regions\n",
        "- **Development and disease** - How epigenetic patterns change during differentiation and in cancer\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use data from three major epigenomic resources:\n",
