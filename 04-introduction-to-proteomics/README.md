# Introduction to Proteomics

**Stanford Data Ocean - Data Science in Precision Medicine**

## Overview

Proteomics represents the large-scale study of proteins, the functional products of genes that carry out the majority of biological processes. Unlike the genome, which is relatively static, the proteome is highly dynamic and varies across different tissues, developmental stages, and disease states. This module provides comprehensive training in proteomic data analysis using mass spectrometry-based approaches.

This module focuses on the analysis of Patient Z from the Integrated Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) study at Stanford University, examining protein abundance changes during infection and recovery to demonstrate the power of proteomics in precision medicine.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- **Understand proteomic technologies** - Learn mass spectrometry principles and quantitative proteomics
- **Analyze protein abundance data** - Process and normalize MS-based protein quantification data
- **Identify differentially expressed proteins** - Statistical methods for protein abundance changes
- **Perform functional pathway analysis** - Connect protein changes to biological processes
- **Master proteomics visualization** - Create publication-quality plots for protein data
