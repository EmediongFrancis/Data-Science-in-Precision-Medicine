# Why do we need clincal tests?

Clinical tests use to measure levels of chemical components in body fluids and tissues. The goal of clincal tests are to obtain information about the health of a patient to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.



# What are the different types of clinical laboratory tests?
Many different tests exist to detect and measure almost any type of chemical component such as blood glucose, electrolytes, enzymes, hormones, lipids (fats), other metabolic substances, and proteins in blood or urine [1].

The more common laboratory tests are `Urine test` `Blood tests` and `Tumor markers`.


`Urine test`: Urinalysis is a laboratory examination of urine for various cells and chemicals, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, infection, or excessive protein [2].

For exmample, blood in the urine (hematuria) may be the result of a benign (noncancerous) condition, but it can also indicate an infection or other problem. High levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) may indicate a kidney or cardiovascular problem.

`Blood test`: Blood tests are offed used to check cell counts, measure various blood chemistries and markers of inflammation, and genetics [3].

`Tumor markers`: Tumor markers are substances either released by cancer cells into the blood or urine or substances created by the body in response to cancer cells [4].


# Plot using clinical data

In this module, we are going to plot the clincal data using python from a study published in Nature Medicine in 2019, `A longitudinal big data approach for precision health` [5].

This study collected blood samples from participants every three months for up to 8 years. The study team discovered more than 67 clinically actionable health discoveries and identified multiple molecular pathways associated with metabolic, cardiovascular and oncologic pathophysiology.

They also developed prediction models for insulin resistance by using omics measurements, illustrating their potential to replace burdensome tests. [5]

# What do the plots tells us?

Before we try to plot Figure 3a, 3b, 3c from the publication, let's try to understand what they mean. You could also reference the figures in publication here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0414-6/figures/3

These figures follow the laboratory tests for different study participants over time. They show that different people develop diabetes through different pathways, or with different initial signs of glucose dysregulation.

Each laboratory test **measures a specific aspect of glucose physiology**:

1. **FPG** - Fasting Plasma Glucose  

  It measures how well the body maintains a healthy blood glucose level in a stable environment (i.e.  homeostasis).  
  Values of 126 or above suggest that an individual might have diabetes.


2. **OGTT2HR** - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test

  It measures how well a person's body processes glucose when they receive a large amount of glucose (75gm) at once.  
  Glucose is then measured in the blood. Blood glucose levels of 200 or above are an indicator of diabetes.


3. **SSPG** - Steady-State Plasma Glucose

  It measures insulin resistance, or how well the body responds to insulin.  
  Blood glucose levels of 150 or above are considered insulin resistant. It means the body doesn‚Äôt respond as well to insulin, leading to higher blood glucose levels.


4. **HbA1C** - Hemoglobin A1C, or Glycated Hemoglobin

  It is another measure of how much sugar is in the blood. When there is a lot of sugar in the blood, it glycates (sticks to) hemoglobin.
  
  The more sugar in the blood, the more it sticks.  Since the red blood cells contain hemoglobin that last around three months, it is considered a measure of average blood glucose levels over the last three months. Values of 6.5 or above are indicative of diabetes.



## Figure 3a: Initial abnormality of OGTT2HR - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test

It shows a participant (ID: ZNDMXI3) first developed an OGTT in the diabetic range. Blood glucose levels of 200 or above are an indicator of diabetes. Here, we see measurement of 208 and 263.

## Figure 3b: Initial abnormality of FPG - Fasting Plasma Glucose
It shows a participant (ID: ZNED4XZ) first had an abnormality in fasting glucose (glucose homeostasis). Values of 126 or above suggest that an individual might have diabetes. Here, we see multiple numeric values in red are above 126.

<img src="materials/images/fig3b.png"/>

## Figure 3c: Initial improvement followed by progression after viral infections

It shows a participant (ID:ZOZOWIT) had developed a diabetic range fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C after a viral infection.

This participant was able to bring these labs back to the normal range through lifestyle changes.

However, after a second viral infection, they then developed elevated blood glucose levels, including fasting glucose, OGTT and HbA1C in the diabetic range.

# Create plots using clinical data from 3 study participants


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

## Figure 3a: Initial abnormality of OGTT2HR - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test

Let's use data from participant (ID: ZNDMXI3) to plot the measurements from the four laboratory tests.

We will label the values in diabetic range using the color red to make them stand out. The diabetic range for the tests are:
- **FPG**: any value ‚â• 126
- **OGTT2HR**: any value ‚â• 200
- **SSPG**: any value ‚â• 150
- **HbA1C**: any value ‚â• 6.5

Check the plot after you run the code, and see if you can see that this participant had developed an OGTT blood glucose levels of 200 or above.
