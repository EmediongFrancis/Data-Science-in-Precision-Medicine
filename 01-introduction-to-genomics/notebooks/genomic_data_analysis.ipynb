    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on exploration of genomic data analysis. In this notebook, we'll work through real genomic datasets to understand how genetic variants are distributed across human populations and what they can tell us about disease risk, ancestry, and even everyday traits like eye color.\n",

    "## What we'll cover\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through several key concepts in genomic data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding genomic data structure** - What do VCF files actually contain?\n",
    "- **Population genetics** - How genetic variants differ across global populations\n",
    "- **Clinical annotation** - Connecting genetic variants to disease databases\n",
    "- **Gene-level analysis** - Finding variants within specific genes of interest\n",
    "- **Data visualization** - Making sense of complex genomic datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use three major genomic databases:\n",
    "- **1000 Genomes Project** - Population-scale genetic variation data\n",
    "- **COSMIC** - Cancer-related genetic mutations\n",
    "- **UCSC RefGene** - Human gene annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses here use real genomic datasets hosted on AWS. If you don't have AWS access configured, don't worry - the notebook includes sample data that demonstrates the same concepts. The patterns and insights we'll discover are based on actual research findings.\n",

    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored several key concepts in genomic data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data structure**: Genomic variants are stored in standardized formats (VCF) with specific fields for location, alleles, and quality metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population genetics**: Genetic variants show dramatic frequency differences across human populations, reflecting evolutionary history and migration patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical annotation**: By comparing population variants with disease databases, we can identify genetic factors that contribute to disease risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gene-level analysis**: Focusing on specific genes (like TP53) reveals how evolutionary pressure shapes genetic variation in functionally important regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavioral genetics**: Genetics influences not just disease risk, but also everyday traits like taste preferences and social behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical implications\n",
    "\n",
    "These analyses demonstrate why genetic ancestry matters in precision medicine. Different populations have different genetic risk profiles, which means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disease risk prediction models need to account for ancestry\n",
    "- Drug dosing and efficacy may vary by genetic background\n",
    "- Genetic testing interpretation requires population context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue learning about genomic data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up AWS access** to work with the full datasets\n",
    "2. **Explore the `genomic_utils.py` module** to see additional analysis functions\n",
    "3. **Run the `demo.py` script** for a complete workflow example\n",
    "4. **Try analyzing other genes** of interest (BRCA1, APOE, etc.)\n",
    "5. **Look into GWAS data** for genome-wide association studies\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of genomics is rapidly evolving, with new discoveries constantly emerging. The analytical approaches we've covered here form the foundation for understanding how genetic variation contributes to human health and disease.\n"
